-[DONE] Add max depth calibration setting (tree & forest)
-[DONE] Cache leaves position in tree evaluation
-Clean & rewrite tree interface
-n-dimensionnal case, with n>1
-[Done] Optimize data partitionning when building tree
-Make clear that the algo awaits data sorted according to the current regression variable
-Find more efficient mgt of buckets with same points? side effect : partitions with 0 points
-Force max depth spec in tree to avoid costly resize?
-Remove Linq.Contains in GetLeaves & cache leaves (not critical, most of the job already done)
